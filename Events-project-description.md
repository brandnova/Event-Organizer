**Project Description: Event Organizer and Ticketing Platform**

### **Overview**

This project is a **Django-based Event Organizer and Ticketing Platform** designed to simplify the process of event creation, management, and ticket sales. The platform allows event organizers to list their events, manage attendees, and sell tickets online. It provides attendees with an easy way to browse events, purchase tickets, and access them digitally. The platform incorporates monetization options such as commission on ticket sales, premium event listings, and Google AdSense integration. Future scalability and optional enhancements, including a Progressive Web App (PWA) for event check-ins, make it a highly flexible solution for event management.
